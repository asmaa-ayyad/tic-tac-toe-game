# Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) Game in Dart

Hi! This is a simple console game I made using the Dart programming language. It’s the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game (X and O) where two players take turns choosing positions from 1 to 9.

The game runs in the terminal and updates the board after each move. It checks who wins or if the game ends in a draw. I also added a check so that a player can’t choose a taken number by mistake.


## How to run it

First, make sure you have Dart installed. You can download it from:https://dart.dev/get-dart

After you have Dart, clone the repository using this command:

git clone https://github.com/asmaa-ayyad/tic-tac-toe-game.git


Open the folder:

cd tic-tac-toe-game


Then run the game with:

dart run

Or if your Dart file is inside a bin/ folder, use:

dart run bin/main.dart


Example of what it looks like:

X | 2 | 3
---------
4 | O | 6
---------
7 | 8 | O

The game will tell you if someone wins or if it’s a draw
 and ask if you want to play again.
